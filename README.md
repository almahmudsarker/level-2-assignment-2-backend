:link: Setting up the Development Environment
:arrow_forward: Step 1: Clone the Repository
Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using Git.

```bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
```

:arrow_forward: Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository.

```bash
Copy code
cd <repository-name>
```

:arrow_forward: Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the project's dependencies using npm.

```bash
Copy code
npm install
```

This command will read the package.json file in the project directory and install all required packages from the npm registry, creating a node_modules directory.

:arrow_forward: Step 4: Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project to hold environment variables. Define variables as needed, typically including things like database URLs or API keys.

Example .env file:

plaintext
Copy code
PORT=3000
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase
SECRET_KEY=my_secret_key
Ensure these variables are correctly referenced in your application, often in a configuration file within the ./src/config directory.

:arrow_forward: Step 5: Start the Development Server
Launch the development server using the provided npm script:

```bash
Copy code
npm run start:dev
```

In your package.json file, ensure you have a script defined as start:dev to run the server. Example:

```json
Copy code
"scripts": {
    "start:dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only ./src/server.ts",
    "start:prod": "node ./dist/server.js",
    //...other scripts
  }
```

:arrow_forward: Step 6: Access the Application
Once the server is running, access the application by navigating to http://localhost:<port> in your web browser, replacing <port> with the specified port number in your .env file.

Follow these steps to set up your development environment and run your Express.js application locally.
